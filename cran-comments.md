## Release Summary

This is the first release of 'fredr'. 'fredr' provides a complete R interface
to the FRED (Federal Reserve of Economic Data, St. Louis) API.

Notes to CRAN: We understand that generally examples should not be wrapped in
\dontrun{}. However, all examples wrapped in \dontrun{} require API
authentication and would fail on CRAN. We test extensively on Travis and 
Appveyor. The 'riingo' package does a similar thing, and its author is a
co-author here.
