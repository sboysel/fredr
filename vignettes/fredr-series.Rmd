# Introduction

This vignette is intended to introduce the user to `fredr` functions for the [Series
endpoint](https://research.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/#Series) of the FRED API.

FRED __series__ are the primary data objects in the FRED database.  Each FRED series is assigned a string identifier.  For example:

- Civilian Unemployment Rate (`series_id = "UNRATE"`)
- Real Gross National Product (`series_id = "GNPCA"`)
- Effective Federal Funds Rate (`series_id = "FEDFUNDS"`)

FRED series are assigned categories and tags attributes for organization and classification.  The following examples illustrate usage of the Series endpoint functions in `fredr`.

## Retrieve observations

The function `fredr()`, an alias for `fredr_series_observations()`, is the core function in `fredr` for fetching FRED data series.  See the [Get started](http://sboysel.github.io/fredr/articles/fredr.html) article and `fredr()` for usage examples.

## Search for FRED series

Use `fredr_series_search_text()` to search for a series _by text_ in the series description.  The data returned is a `tibble` where each row represents series with description text that matches the text specified by `search_text`.  For example, to search for series with description text that matches "UNRATE":

```{r fredr_series_search_text1}
fredr_series_search_text(
  search_text = "unemployment",
  limit = 100L
)
```

Use `fredr_series_search_id()` to search for a series _by integer ID_ of the series.  The data returned is a `tibble` where each row represents series with an ID that matches the text specified by `search_text`.  For example, to search for series with an ID that matches "UNRATE":

```{r fredr_search_id1}
fredr_series_search_id(
  search_text = "UNRATE",
  limit = 100L
)
```

## Search for FRED series by tags

Use `fredr_series_search_tags()` to search for series tags.  The data returned is a `tibble` where each row represents a tag matching the text in `series_search_text`.  For example, to return the top 100 tags (by series count) matching the text "unemployment":

```{r fredr_series_search_tags, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fredr_series_search_tags(
  series_search_text = "unemployment",
  limit = 100L
)
```

## Search for FRED series by related tags

Use `fredr_search_related_tags()` to search for series tags related to a given tag.  The data returned is a `tibble` where each row represents a tag matching the text in `series_search_text` and related tags specified by `tag_names`.  For example, to search for tags related to the tag "usa" in which the series text matches "gnp", use the following:

```{r fredr_search_related_tags1}
fredr_series_search_related_tags(
  series_search_text = "gnp",
  tag_names = "usa",
  limit = 30L
)
```

## Get basic information for a FRED series

The `fredr_series()` function returns information for a single series specified by `series_id`.  The data returned is a `tibble` in which each row represents the series specified.  For example, to get information for the `UNRATE` series:

```{r fredr_series1}
fredr_series(series_id = "UNRATE")
```

Note that there may potentially be more than one row returned if the series has been revised and [real time periods](https://research.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/realtime_period.html) are adjusted:

```{r fredr_series2}
fredr_series(
  series_id = "UNRATE",
  realtime_start = as.Date("1950-01-01")
)
```

## Get the categories for a FRED series

The `fredr_series_categories()` function returns a list of categories for the series specified by `series_id`.  The data returned is a `tibble` in which each row represents a category that the series belongs to.  For example, to get the categories for the `UNRATE` series:

```{r fredr_series_categories1}
fredr_series_categories(series_id = "UNRATE")
```

## Get the release for a FRED series

The `fredr_series_release()` function returns a list of releases that the series specified by `series_id` belongs to.  The data returned is a `tibble` in which each row represents a release that the series belongs to.  For example, to get the release for the `UNRATE` series:

```{r fredr_series_release1}
fredr_series_release(series_id = "UNRATE")
```

## Get the tags for a FRED series

The `fredr_series_tags()` function returns a list of tags that are assigned to the series specified by `series_id`.  The data returned is a `tibble` in which each row represents a tag assigned to the series.  For example, to get the tags for the `UNRATE` series:

```{r fredr_series_tags1}
fredr_series_tags(
  series_id = "UNRATE",
  order_by = "name"
)
```

## Get a set of recently updated FRED series

The `fredr_series_updates()` function returns a list of series recently updated on the FRED server.  The data returned is a `tibble` in which each row represents a series.  For example, the default call simply lists 1000 recent updates (the default for the `limit` parameter), most recent updates appearing first:
 
```{r fredr_series_updates1}
fredr_series_updates()
```

Use the `start_time` and `end_time` parameters to filter the results by time.  For example, to get all the macroeconomic times series updated in the last hour:

```{r fredr_series_updates2}
fredr_series_updates(
  start_time = Sys.time() - 60 * 60,
  end_time = Sys.time(),
  filter_value = "macro"
)
```


## Get the data vintage dates for a FRED series

The `fredr_series_vintagedates()` function returns a sequence of dates in history when the series specified by `series_id` was revised or appended to.  The data returned is a `tibble` where row is a date.  For example, to get the vintage dates for the series `UNRATE`:

```{r fredr_series_vintagedates1}
fredr_series_vintagedates(series_id = "UNRATE")
```
